# my_bittle

This is a package that enables control via keyboard of
the [Bittle robot from Petoi](https://www.petoi.com/pages/bittle-open-source-bionic-robot-dog). This project is not
affiliated with petoi or bittle officially. Try this project with your bittle on a test stand first where bittle's feat
can't touch the ground, as it may result in commands that break your bittle.

## Installation

```
pip install my-bittle
```
